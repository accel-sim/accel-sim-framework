/* TO DO:
 * NOTE: the current version of trace-driven is functionally working fine,
 * but we still need to improve traces compression and simulation speed.
 * This includes:
 *
 * 1- Prefetch concurrent thread that prefetches traces from disk (to not be
 * limited by disk speed)
 *
 * 2- traces compression format a) cfg format and remove
 * thread/block Id from the head and b) using zlib library to save in binary
 * format
 *
 * 3- Efficient memory improvement (save string not objects - parse only 10 in
 * the buffer)
 *
 * 4- Seeking capability - thread scheduler (save tb index and warp
 * index info in the traces header)
 *
 * 5- Get rid off traces intermediate files -
 * changeÂ the tracer
