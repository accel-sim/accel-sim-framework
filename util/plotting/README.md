# Quick bar-charts

* Make sure CUDA\_INSTALL\_PATH is set and bin/lib directories are in PATH and LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
* You can use `./util/job_launching/get_stats.py` to generate csvs that can be plotted in any way you like.
    In this folder `./plot-get-stats.py` provides a quick way to generate bar charts from the output of `./get-stats.py`
    For example:
```bash
# Run simulations using SASS (assumes you have built accel-sim and pulled the trace files)
../job_launching/run_simulations.py -B rodinia_2.0-ft -C QV100-SASS -T ../../hw_run/rodinia_2.0-ft/9.1/ -N rodinia-sass

# Run simulations using PTX (assumes you have built accel-sim, the apps and pulled their data)
../job_launching/run_simulations.py -B rodinia_2.0-ft -C QV100-PTX  -N rodinia-ptx

# Wait for jobs to finish
../job_launching/monitor_func_test.py -N rodinia-sass
../job_launching/monitor_func_test.py -N rodinia-ptx

# Collect the stats from both jobs:
../job_launching/get_stats.py -R -C QV100-SASS,QV100-PTX -B rodinia_2.0-ft | tee per-app-stats.csv
./plot-get-stats.py -c per-app-stats.csv
```

All stats collected by the `get_stats.py` file will be plotted and placed in ./htmls/.
[An example for the IPC is here](https://engineering.purdue.edu/tgrogers/accel-sim/example-plots/example.plot.rodinia_2.0-ft.html).

# Instructions on plotting correlation graphs

* Make sure CUDA\_INSTALL\_PATH is set and bin/lib directories are in PATH and LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
* This is reliant on:
    * The benchmarks have been run using the `run_simulations.py` script
    * The hardware apps have been run using the run\_hw.py script (or downloaded our posted statistics using `./util/get_hw_data.sh`)
    * Plottly is installed
        ```bash
        pip install --target=~/python-package plotly
        export PYTHONPATH=~/python-package:$PYTHONPATH
        echo "export PYTHONPATH=~/python-package:$PYTHONPATH" >> ~/.bashrc
        ```
    * Generate the statistics file for the simulator using:
    ```bash
    ../job_launching/get_stats.py -R -K -k -C <Your config name> -B <simulator apps> > correl.stats.csv
    # An example: ../job_launching/get_stats.py -R -K -k -C QV100-SASS,QV100-PTX -B rodinia_2.0-ft > correl.stats.csv
    ./plot-correlation.py -c correl.stats.csv
    # stdout will print summary statistics and html files will be generated in ./correl-html/
    # You can generate pdf files instead using
    ./plot-correlation.py -c correl.stats.csv -H ../../hw_run/QUADRO-V100/9.1/
    # You can also generate pdf files for the correaltions using "-i pdf"
    ```
[Here is an example correlation plot for the simple rodinia tests aggregated per-app](https://engineering.purdue.edu/tgrogers/accel-sim/example-plots/gv100-cycles.QV100-PTX.QV100-SASS.per-app.html).
[And per-kernel](https://engineering.purdue.edu/tgrogers/accel-sim/example-plots/gv100-cycles.QV100-PTX.QV100-SASS.per-kernel.html).
Note again - that these short-running tests are not representative of longer running GPU apps and the correlation on these applications should
be taken into context.

We map the hardware Nvprof and Nvsight statistics with the Accel-Sim reported statistics. To see the 1:1 mapping, read [this speadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oLbNX-5qTnF9x4v-GCUKuA5zvjx72yD0D2rJIllBHds/edit#gid=0). Also, see the [./correl_mappings.py](https://github.com/accel-sim/accel-sim-framework/blob/dev/util/plotting/correl_mappings.py) file for the exact mapping in python script.
